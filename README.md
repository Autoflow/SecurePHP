## SecurePHP - error mailer and runtime sensitizing

* predefined error reports
  - error tickets
  - config errors
  - info & notice reports
  - init errors
  - success reports
  - timer alerts
  - transaction & transition errors
  - uncaught exception errors

* send errors to email inboxes
  - send to admin
  - send to users
  - send to cc
  
* treat E_NOTICE's as E_ERROR's (strict mode)
  - catch type conversion errors
  - catch undefined variables, indexes and offsets
  - [â€¦]
  
* catch recurring errors
  - inform about repetitives errors (ie. every 30 minutes)
  - optimized for cronjobs

* loose mode
  - handle errors as PHP does

* EOF detection
  - get informed when PHP doesn't reach the end of file

* user defined shutdown function
  - set your own shutdown function
