When starting the library PHP will be set to a silent and more sensitive mode.
The PHP environment will be set as follows:

* [strict mode](doc/strict.md)
 - E_NOTICEs are turned to E_ERRORs and script will be halted
 - E_WARNINGs will be turned to E_ERRORs and script will be halted

* [mute mode](doc/mute.md)
 - display errors will be deactivated for CLI and SAPI environment

This settings can be easily changed to a less tight handling.
See the docs for [strict mode](doc/strict.md) and[mute mode](doc/mute.md).
